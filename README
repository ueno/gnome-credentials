About gnome-credentials
=======================

gnome-credentials is an attempt to implement the new "Passwords and
Keys" application design:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnome-design-team/gnome-mockups/master/passwords-and-keys/passwords-and-keys.png

Currently only passwords and GnuPG keys are supported.  For GnuPG
keys, the GPGME library is required:
https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/swlist.html#gpgme

Still very much work in progress.
