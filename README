About gnome-credentials
=======================

gnome-credentials is an attempt to implement the new "Passwords and
Keys" application design:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnome-design-team/gnome-mockups/master/passwords-and-keys/passwords-and-keys.png

The GPGME library is required for GnuPG support.

Still very much work in progress.
