About gnome-credentials
=======================

gnome-credentials is a prototyping effort to implement the new
"Passwords and Keys" application design:
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=711252
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnome-design-team/gnome-mockups/master/passwords-and-keys/passwords-and-keys.png

The code is largely based on Seahorse, and it might be eventually
merged back, once the design and features have been finalized.
